UI/UX Design
The UI follows Material 3 design principles with:

Bottom Navigation: Intuitive navigation between main sections
FAB (Floating Action Button): Quick task creation
Swipe Actions: Efficient task completion and deletion
Drag-and-Drop: Intuitive task reordering
Dynamic Theming: Material 3 color system for a cohesive look

Performance Optimizations
Several optimizations have been implemented to ensure smooth performance even with large task lists:

LazyColumn with Key Derivation: Efficient list rendering with stable item identity
Optimized Recomposition: Smart use of remember, derivedStateOf, and key parameters
Shimmer Loading Effect: Visual feedback during data loading
Background Processing: Heavy operations run on background threads
State Hoisting: Minimizes recomposition cascades
Rememberized Callbacks: Prevents unnecessary recompositions
Custom SwipeToDismiss: Optimized performance compared to standard implementation

Swipe-to-Dismiss Implementation
The app uses a custom implementation of SwipeToDismiss that provides:

Bi-directional swiping: Left for deletion and right for completion
Visual feedback: Color and icon changes based on swipe direction
Haptic feedback: Subtle vibration on action completion
Undo functionality: Snackbar with undo option after actions
Animation: Smooth animations for all swipe states

Drag-and-Drop Reordering
Task reordering uses the reorderable library with:

Long-press activation: Intuitive gesture to start reordering
Visual feedback: Elevation and scaling during dragging
Haptic feedback: Vibration on pick-up and drop
Persistent ordering: Saved to database automatically

Library Choices

Hilt: For dependency injection with less boilerplate compared to Dagger
Room: For robust, SQL-based local database with Kotlin coroutines support
Jetpack Compose: Modern declarative UI toolkit for more maintainable UI code
Coroutines & Flow: For asynchronous operations and reactive programming
Compose Navigation: Type-safe navigation with support for arguments
DataStore: Modern replacement for SharedPreferences with Flow support
Feather Icons: Consistent icon set that works well with the app's aesthetic
ComposeReorderable: Specialized library for drag-and-drop functionality
Calendar Compose: Optimized calendar selection UI
Toasty: Enhanced toast messages with better visual styling
